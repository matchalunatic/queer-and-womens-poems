“O Blood of the River of songs,  
O songs of the River of Blood,”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me lie down. Let my words  
  
Lie sound in the mouths of men  
Repeating invocations pure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perfect as a moan  
  
That mounts in the mouth of Bessie Smith.  
Blues for the angels kicked out  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven. Blues for the angels  
  
Who miss them still. Blues  
For my people and what water  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know. O weary drinkers  
  
Drinking from the bloody river,  
Why go to heaven with Harlem  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So close? Why sing of rivers  
  
With fathers of our own to miss?  
I remember mine and taste a stain  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like blood coursing the body  
  
Of a man chased by a mob. I write  
His running, his sweat: here,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbs a poplar for the sky,  
  
But it is only sky. The river?  
Follow me. You’ll see. We tried  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fly and learned we couldn’t  
  
Swim. Dear singing river full  
Of my blood, are we as loud under  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water? Is it blood that binds  
  
Brothers? Or is it the Mississippi  
Running through the fattest vein  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of America? When I say home,  
  
I mean I wanted to write some  
Lines. I wanted to hear the blues,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here I am swimming in the river  
  
Again. What flows through the fat  
Veins of a drowned body? What  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America can a body call  
  
Home? When I say Congo, I mean  
Blood. When I say Nile, I mean blood.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say Euphrates, I mean,  
  
If only you knew what blood  
We have in common. So much,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Louisiana, they call a man like me  
  
Red. And red was too dark  
For my daddy. And my daddy was  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too dark for America. He ran  
  
Like a man from my mother  
And me. And my mother’s sobs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the songs of Bessie Smith  
  
Who wears more feathers than  
Death. O the death my people refuse  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die. When I was 18, I wrote down  
  
The river though I couldn’t win  
A race, climbed a tree that winter, then  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell, flat on my wet, red face. Line  
  
After line, I read all the time,  
But “there was nothing I could do  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About race.”
