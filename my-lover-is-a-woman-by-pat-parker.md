I.

my lover is a woman  
& when i hold her  
feel her warmth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i feel good  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel safe  
  
then—i never think of  
my family’s voices  
never hear my sisters say  
bulldaggers, queers, funny  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come see us, but don’t  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring your friends  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s ok with us,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but don’t tell mama  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it’d break her heart  
never feel my father  
turn in his grave  
never hear my mother cry  
Lord, what kind of child is this?  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
II.  
  
my lover’s hair is blonde  
& when it rubs across my face  
it feels soft  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feels like a thousand fingers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touch my skin & hold me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and i feel good  
  
then—i never think of the little boy  
who spat & called me nigger  
never think of the policemen  
who kicked my body & said crawl  
never think of Black bodies  
hanging in trees or filled  
with bullet holes  
never hear my sisters say  
white folks hair stinks  
don’t trust any of them  
never feel my father  
turn in his grave  
never hear my mother talk  
of her backache after scrubbing floors  
never hear her cry  
Lord, what kind of child is this?  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
III.   
  
my lover's eyes are blue  
& when she looks at me  
i float in a warm lake  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel my muscles go weak with want  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel good  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel safe  
  
then—i never think of the blue  
eyes that have glared at me  
moved three stools away from me  
in a bar  
never hear my sisters rage  
of syphilitic Black men as  
guinea pigs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rage of sterilized children  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watch them just stop in an  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intersection to scare the old  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white bitch  
never feel my father turn  
in his grave  
never remember my mother  
teaching me the yes sirs & ma'ams  
to keep me alive  
never hear my mother cry  
Lord, what kind of child is this?  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
IV.  
  
& when we go to a gay bar  
& my people shun me because i crossed  
the line  
& her people look to see what's  
wrong with her  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what defect  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drove her to me  
  
& when we walk the streets  
of this city  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forget and touch  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or hold hands  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& the people  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stare, glare, frown, & taunt  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at those queers  
  
i remember  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every word taught me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every word said to me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every deed done to me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& then i hate  
i look at my lover  
& for an instant  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt  
  
then—i hold her hand tighter  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& i can hear my mother cry.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, what kind of child is this?
