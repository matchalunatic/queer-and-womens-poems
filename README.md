We use these poems as source material for trainings I give to queer and non-binary people and women.

I did not want Lorem Ipsum. Poetry is powerful.

That's it.

None of these were written by us unless otherwise stated.

Love.

These are meant to be embedded in a Hugo website.

# Adding your stuff

Open a merge request.

Try to use Header.md as a basis to fill the metadata.

Use the regex I provide to format. If not we'll do it, don't worry.

Super happy to have you here btw.
