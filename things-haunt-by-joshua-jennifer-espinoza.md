California is a desert and I am a woman inside it.  
The road ahead bends sideways and I lurch within myself.  
I’m full of ugly feelings, awful thoughts, bad dreams  
of doom, and so much love left unspoken.  
  
Is mercury in retrograde? someone asks.  
Someone answers, No, it’s something else  
like that though. Something else like that.  
That should be my name.  
  
When you ask me am I really a woman, a human being,  
a coherent identity, I’ll say No, I’m something else  
like that though.  
  
A true citizen of planet earth closes their eyes  
and says what they are before the mirror.  
A good person gives and asks for nothing in return.  
I give and I ask for only one thing—  
  
Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me. Hear me.  
Hear me. Bear the weight of my voice and don’t forget—  
things haunt. Things exist long after they are killed.
