Breathe  
. As in what if  
the shadow is gold  
en? Breathe. As in  
hale assuming  
exhale. Imagine  
that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in first  
person singular. Homonym  
:eye. As in subject. As  
in centeroftheworld as in  
mundane. The opposite of spectacle  
spectacular. This is just us  
breathing. Imagine  
normalized respite  
gold in shadows  
. You have the  
right to breathe and remain  
. Imagine  
that  
.
